# Predicting-Employee-Turnover
Applying predicting analytics to predict employee attrition

This Data Mining Project aims to use predictor variables such as gender, satisfaction, salary, etc. to predict whether an employee will leave an organization for a specific time period. 

The objective for this project is to increase companies’ ability to address the high employee turnover rate problem. By applying prediction analytics on employee attrition, companies then can analyze the process and lessen the turnover rate by focusing on the specific types of works likely to resign and maintain useful talents. Ultimately, it will help improve the companies’ HR practices, contributing to employee satisfaction and business success.
